        <h2>Let US decide what you have to eat and drink tonight!</h2>

        <p>
            We're all busy people with jobs, and hobbies, and family that take up some of our time, so who has time to think of things like what they should make on a given night?</p>
        </p>

        <p>
            That's why we have done all the thinking for you! By simply selecting between food or drink (or both!) we will select an alcoholic beverage and a meal for you to enjoy so all you have to worry about is ingredients!
