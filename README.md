# Food and Drink Randomizer

Our website will implement the follwing user story:

* As a consumer, I want to randomly select a drink and/or dinner option with the click of a button

* If I do not like either of the options, I can either press the individual button to get a new drink or dinner or press the "Get Both" button to get new options of both.
 
* Additionally, I can press the "Get Restaurant" button to receive a restaurant recommendation.
