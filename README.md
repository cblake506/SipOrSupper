# Sip or Supper!

"Instant recipes for your next meal at home"

Our website will implement the following user story:

* As a consumer, I want to randomly receive a drink and/or dinner option with the click of a button.

* The website will give both a list of ingredients and instructions on how to make the drink or dinner.
    * Additionally, the dinner option will also provide a YouTube tutorial showing how to make the item.

* If I do not like either of the options, I can either press the individual button to get a new drink or dinner or press the "Get Both" button to get new options of both.
